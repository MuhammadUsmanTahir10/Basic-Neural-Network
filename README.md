# Basic Neural Network:
Here a neural network is designed to showcase the working methodology and basic mathematics behind neural networks

This simple project displays the working of a basic neural network and the mathematics that is involved in developing a neural nets, so lets get started:

First we will start by discussing the concept of Machine Learning because neural nets are the core feature of Deep Learning that is a sub field of Machine Learning.

So Whats is Machine Learning?

# Machine Learning:
Machine Learning is a branch of Science, Engineering and Mathematics that is involved in forming algorithms to solve complex mathematical and computing problems such as image recognition, Language Understanding, object classification and many other real world problems by identifiying patterns and rules from training data set based on the provided features, attributes or characteristics. Then with the help of this Machine generated rules the computer or GPU (General Processing Unit) process testing data and give correct results with great accuracy.

Now lets discuss Deep Learning and then we will go into the mathematics of Neural Networks:

# Deep Learning:
Deep learning is the sub brach of Machine Learning, it is actually based on the concept of designing such Machine Learning algorithms using mathematical functions and logics that displays the comlex working priciple of human brains that is based on millions or billions of neurons, so in Deep Learning these mathematical designed functions are called as Artificial neural networks or simply neural nets. These neural nets can be of multiple layers, when they have multile hidden layers then they are termed as Convolution Neural Networks and come under the hood of Deep Learning. These are very powerfull tools and can be used for solving vast amount of complex problems efficiently.

Ok, so lets get started by desingning our own neyral network using python and other supportive libraries.
