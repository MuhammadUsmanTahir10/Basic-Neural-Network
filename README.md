# Basic-Neural-Network
A neural network designed to showcase the working methodology and basic mathematics behind neural networks

This simple project displays the working of a basic neural network and the mathematics that is involved in developing a neural nets, so lets get started:

First we will start by discussing the concept of Machine Learning because neural nets are the core feature of Deep Learning that is a sub field of Machine Learning.
So Whats is Machine Learning?

# Machine Learning:
Machine Learning is a branch of Science, Engineering and Mathematics that is involved in forming algorithms to solve complex mathematical and computing problems such as image recognition, Language Understanding, object classification and many other real world problems based on identifiying patterns and rules from traing data set based on the provided features, attributes or characteristics. Then with the help of this Machine generated rules the computer or GPU (General Processing Unit) process testing data and give correct results with great accuracy.
